= Setting up Kueue resources

In this section, you prepare your {deliverable} environment so that you can use Kueue for distributing training with the Training Operator.

In the _Distributing training jobs with the Training Operator_ section of this {deliverable}, you implement a distributed training job by using Kueue for managing job resources. With Kueue, you can manage cluster resource quotas and how different workloads consume them.

NOTE: If you are using the Red Hat Developer Sandbox, or if you do not intend to use Kueue to schedule your training jobs in the _Distributing training jobs with the Training Operator_ section of this {deliverable}, skip this section and continue to the next section, xref:creating-a-workbench.adoc[Creating a workbench and selecting a workbench image].
